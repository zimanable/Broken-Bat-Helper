## Features

### Roster Page

Adds two new columns:

1. **eSI (Expected SI)**  
   Shows the expected SI value of a player once they are fully developed, based on their current potential.

2. **potSI (Potential SI gains)**  
   Displays the difference between the player's current SI and their expected SI.

### Player Page

- **Green squares** indicate the maximum value of each attribute based on the scouting report.
- **Numeric values** are displayed in parentheses next to each attribute.
- **Expected SI** is shown in parentheses next to the potential rating.

### Notes

The attribute and SI values were originally sourced from the Broken Bat forum.
